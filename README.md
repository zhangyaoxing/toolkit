# Mouse Mover
Move cursor or window to the target screen.

## Usage
```bash
./build.sh
mv MouseMover.app ~/Applications
```

3 hot keys are defined:
- Command + Shift + 1: move mouse to screen 0 center.
- Command + Shift + 2: move mouse to screen 1 center.
- Command + Shift + 3: move mouse to screen 2 center.

If mouse button is down (E.g. dragging a window), move to the same position of the target screen.

**Important**: in order to get the full feature, you need to allow the application to control your computer. Go to "Privacy & Security" -> "Accessibility" and add MouseMover to the list.
